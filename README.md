# weather_dashboard

## Description

I created this weather dashboard so users can search the weather for any city by name. Upon search, users are delivered the current weather data as well as a five-day forecast. The users' city search history is locally stored so they can go back to a previously searched city by simply clicking on it in the search history.  Through this project, I learned how to successfully work with a server-side API and create a working web application surrounding it. 

## Usage
